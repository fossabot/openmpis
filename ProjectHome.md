The lack of a centralized service for disseminating advisories, a joint effort for finding missing Filipinos and a free and open source Missing Persons Information System compelled me to propose my own implementation. The purposes of this research are a.) to implement an information system that will integrate and consolidate all government efforts in finding missing, abducted, runaway, throwaway and abandoned and reporting found and unidentified persons; b.) to inform and encourage citizens to look out for these missing persons; and c.) to promote awareness for the public in keeping their relatives safe.
